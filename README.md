# Post-Quantum Cryptography EVM Benchmark

Post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) signing schemes are known for being resource-intensive, whether due to computational demands or the size and storage requirements of their keys. This repository is dedicated to benchmarking various schemes—such as Lamport, Winternitz, and Rainbow—by evaluating the costs associated with implementing them in EVM smart contracts for signature validation.
